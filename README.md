## Hello and welcome!

I'm a software and full-stack web developer. Completed training at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/) and eager to put my knowledge to use.

My current side-project is [musicli](https://github.com/BenHall-7/musicli), a text UI for editing MIDI music files on the command line. I host my portfolio [here](https://bh7.dev/). You can also find my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminjahall/)
